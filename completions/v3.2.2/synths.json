This effect is created using the pulse ugen which produces a variable width square wave. We then control the width of the pulses using a variety of LFOs - sin-osc and lf-tri in this case. We use a number of these LFO modulated pulse ugens with varying LFO type and rate (and phase in some cases) to provide the LFO with a different starting point. We then mix all these pulses together to create a thick sound and then feed it through a resonant low pass filter (rlpf). For extra bass, one of the pulses is an octave lower (half the frequency) and its LFO has a little bit of randomisation thrown into its frequency component for that extra bit of variety.\n\nSynth design adapted from:\nThe Prophet Speaks (page 2)\nSteal This Sound,  Mitchell Sigman",
